        <p>This policy outlines how files uploaded to Kirsty and Nialls upload website for their wedding. By uploading files, you agree to the terms described below.</p>
        <h2>Purpose of Collection</h2> 
        <p>The files you upload, including photos and videos, are collected solely for the purpose of preserving and sharing the precious memories of your special wedding day. These files are intended for the wedding couple's personal remembrance and enjoyment.</p>
<h2>Data Ownership</h2>
	<p>You retain full ownership of all files you upload to our server. You are granting us a limited license to store and manage these files for the purposes outlined in this policy.</p>
<h2>Storage and Security</h2>
	<p>Your files are securely stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS), a leading cloud computing platform. AWS employs robust security measures to protect data. While we take all reasonable steps to protect your data, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
<h2>Access and Sharing</h2>
	<p>Your uploaded files will be handled exclusively by myself and the wedding couple. No other third parties will have access to or handle your files unless explicitly agreed upon by the wedding couple for specific services.</p>
<h2>Retention Period</h2>
	<p>Your files will be retained on our AWS server for as long as uploading website is operational and active. In the event that uploading website ceases to be operational, all uploaded files will be securely transferred to the wedding couple. We will contact the wedding couple to arrange for the secure delivery of their complete file collection.</p>
<h2>Data Deletion Requests</h2>
